 Card game involves a deck of cards with identical pairs of images or symbols on each card. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on a surface, and players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, trying to find a match. If the cards match, the player takes another turn. If the cards do not match, the player flips them back over.
